## Introduction 

Learning Programming
- Nice explanation of the steps required to start and finish a project.
- Why its important to start with a low level language. Project based vs low level start.
- Has links of tutorials and practise problems to learn python, algorithms, data structures etc. 
- Interesting : [Build your own x](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x)
- Algos and Data-structures, [interactive challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges)
- Teach yourself [Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [Teach tech with cartoons](https://jvns.ca/teach-tech-with-cartoons/)

Core Programming:
- Visualize whats being done in the [python interpreter](http://www.pythontutor.com/)
- A [python interpretter written in oython](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html) to understand the low level details of python workings. 
- [Some things to remember when coding in python](http://satyajit.ranjeev.in/2012/05/17/python-a-few-things-to-remember.html)
- [how to add a new statement in python](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/06/30/python-internals-adding-a-new-statement-to-python/)
- [Python innards introduction](https://tech.blog.aknin.name/category/my-projects/pythons-innards/) explains how some of Python's internal execution happens.
- [Python IAQ: Infrequently Asked Questions](http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html) is a list of quirky queries on rare Python features and why certain syntax was or was not built into the language.
- [Getting Started with the Python Internals](https://akaptur.com/blog/2014/08/03/getting-started-with-python-internals/) takes a slice of the huge CPython codebase and deconstructs some of it to see what we can learn about how Python itself is built.

Why use Python ?:
- To Do : explore testing in python. 
- [GitHut](https://githut.info/), a visualization of GitHub language popularity
- dynamically typed system versus statically typed languages [read](http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2010/08/what-to-know-before-debating-type-systems.html)

Python Community: 
- The history behind the decision to move Python to GitHub](https://snarky.ca/the-history-behind-the-decision-to-move-python-to-github/)

Python resources:
- [Essential Reads for Any Python Programmer is a great collection of advice for developers](http://notesbyanerd.com/2017/12/29/essential-reads-for-any-python-programmer/)
- [How to Develop Quality Python Code](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/how-to-develop-quality-python-code) is a good read to begin learning about development environments, application dependencies and project structure.
- Project structure for python, [1](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/), [2](https://coderwall.com/p/lt2kew/python-creating-your-project-structure), [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/193161/what-is-the-best-project-structure-for-a-python-application).
- [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) is an incredible list of Python frameworks, libraries and software. I wish I had this page when I was just getting started.
- it has links to newsletters

Podcasts:
- python specific podcasts with specific interesting episodes.
- some interesting software engineering podcasts. [git podcast](https://www.allthingsgit.com/archives/), [command line heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-3), [full stack radio](https://www.fullstackradio.com/).
