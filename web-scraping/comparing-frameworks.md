# Web Scraping 

There are 3 popular python web scraping frameworks: 
- beautiful soup 
- scrapy 
- selenium 

## Beautiful Soup
Simple to set up, user friendly. Can extract HTML and XML elements with only a few lines of code. 
Drawbacks - it requires dependencies. It is also slow and inefficient and not ideal for large databases.

## Scrapy 
Written with twisted, has asynchronous capabilities and is much faster. Requires no dependencies. 
However it is not very user friendly. 

## Selenoium
It is versatile. It can be used for automated testing and scraping. It works well with javascript scraping. 
It is not designed to be a web scraping framework and it is slow for large datasets.
